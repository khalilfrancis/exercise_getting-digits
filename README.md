**Getting Digits: A Practice Program in Python**

**Getting Digits** is a simple program that prints the corresponding place value of each digit in a three-digit number stored in user_val.

This serves as a gentle, but informative excercise to challenge my understanding of the MODULO operator (%).

Now, you may ask: "What is the MODULO operator?"

Well, MODULO is a basic arthmetic operator (i.e., +,-,*,/) that evaluates the remainder of the division of two integer operands.

For example:

* 18 % 10 is 8. 
	Why? Because 18 / 10 is 1 with a remainder of 8.
* 90 % 90 is 0. 
	Because 90 / 90 is 1 with a remainder of 0.
* 1 % 2 is 1. 
  	Because 1 / 2 is 0 with a remainder of 1.
* 100 % (1 // 2) is undefined. 
  	Because using PEMDAS, (1 // 2 ) evaluates to 0. 
	100 % 0 is undefined (as 100 / 0 is undefined), thus causing the program to terminate.
